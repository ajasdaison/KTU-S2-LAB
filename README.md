## How to Run
To compile and run the programs, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have a C compiler installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository or download the source files.
3. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
4. Create a build directory:
`mkdir build`
``cd build``
5. Generate the build files using CMake:
``cmake ..``
6. Build the project:
``make``
7. Once the build process is complete, you can find the executable files in the `build` directory.
8. Run the desired program:
``./executable_name``
